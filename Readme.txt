Serif Store Account Creation Bot

!

A simple Python bot that uses Selenium to automate the process of creating a free account on the Serif Store checkout page. This project is intended for educational purposes to demonstrate web automation techniques.
Features

    Automated Navigation: Opens Firefox and navigates directly to the specified checkout page.

    Cookie Banner Handling: Intelligently waits for and removes the cookie consent banner.

    Dynamic Form Filling:

        Enters a predefined email and password.

        Generates and enters random first and last names.

    Robust Waits: Uses Selenium's WebDriverWait to reliably handle page loads and element timing.

    JavaScript Clicks: Overcomes tricky elements (like checkboxes) by executing direct JavaScript clicks.

    Error Handling: Includes basic error handling for timeouts and other exceptions.

How It Works

The script follows a step-by-step process to mimic a human user:

    Launches a new Firefox browser window.

    Navigates to the Serif checkout URL.

    Waits for the cookie banner to appear and removes it.

    Enters the user's email and clicks "Continue".

    Fills in a random first name, a random last name, and a password.

    Checks the "Terms and Conditions" box.

    Clicks the final "Create Account" button to complete the process.

Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the script running on your local machine.
Prerequisites

    Python 3: Make sure you have Python 3.6 or newer installed. You can download it from python.org.

    Mozilla Firefox: The script is configured to use Firefox, so you must have it installed.

    GeckoDriver: This is the WebDriver that allows Selenium to control Firefox.

        Download the latest version for your operating system from the GeckoDriver releases page.

        Unzip the file and place geckodriver.exe (on Windows) or geckodriver (on Mac/Linux) in a location that is on your system's PATH.

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/serif-account-bot.git](https://github.com/your-username/serif-account-bot.git)
    cd serif-account-bot

    Install the required Python packages:
    This project uses a requirements.txt file to manage its dependencies. Run the following command in your terminal:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Configuration

    Open the serif_checkout.py file in a text editor.

    Locate the SCRIPT CONFIGURATION section at the top of the file.

    Change the EMAIL_TO_ENTER and PASSWORD_TO_ENTER variables to your desired credentials.

    # Set your desired credentials here.
    EMAIL_TO_ENTER = "your-email@example.com"
    PASSWORD_TO_ENTER = "YourSuperSecureP@ssw0rd!"
